A script that prints 3 lines:
  (like 1-multi_languages.js)
  but by using an array of string and a loop
      The first line: 
                     “C is fun”
      The second line:
                     “Python is cool”
      The third line:
                     “JavaScript is amazing”
      Must use console.log(...) to print all output
      Not allowed to use var
      Not allowed to use any if/else statement
      Can use only one console.log
      Must use a loop (while, for, etc.)
